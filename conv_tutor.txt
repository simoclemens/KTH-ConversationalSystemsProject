User: what about its role in ww2
Tutor: During World War II, industrial jobs played a crucial role in the war effort. These jobs were responsible for manufacturing essential supplies such as airplanes, ships, and ammunition, which were vital for the war. In the Soviet Union, women, old men, and teenagers filled most of these jobs in factories. Despite the challenging conditions, including long working hours and no days off, production did not stop even during frequent bombing raids. In fact, the output of these factories increased to four times its prewar levels. Industrial jobs were instrumental in supporting the war efforts of various countries during World War II.

User: no i meant what about greece's role in ww2
Tutor: During World War II, Greece played a significant role in the conflict. Initially, Greece was invaded by Italy in 1940, which exposed Hitler's southern flank to British air bases in Greece. As a result, Hitler decided to seize both Greece and Yugoslavia in April 1941 to secure his Balkan flank. However, the Greek resistance, along with the British forces, put up a strong fight against the Axis powers. Although Greece eventually fell to the Axis forces, the Greek resistance continued to fight throughout the war. Greece's role in World War II showcased their determination and resistance against the Axis powers.
