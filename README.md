# KTH-ConversationalSystemsProject

### Final project for the KTH course in Conversational Systems

The project is based on a streamlit interface nad exploits OpenAI API for interacting with a GPT3.5 model.  
Preliminary steps in order to run the code:  
- Setup the environment using the file `requirements.txt`
- Insert your OpenAI key in the file `config.py`  

Once the environment and the key have been set run the code using the command `streamlit run Introduction.py`.  
All the details related to the implementation are specified in the project report `report.pdf`.
